# Animated Flatlist Component in React Native

References: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ox0R5jPb04

## Things I learn:
- learn about withTiming method from react-native-reanimated to change animation value
- learn about onViewableItemsChanged props from FlatList component, never used this props before and this props would be useful on future time when I need to do specific thing for component that viewed on screen.
- one thing to note, onViewableItemsChanged would causing error on fast refresh, since this props not support changing on the fly
